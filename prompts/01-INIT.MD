I need you to set up a Node.js monorepo. I have pnpm installed. The monorepo will have two projects: Phase3 frontend and
Colyseum backend. We will be developing a real-time strategy game similar to Dune 2. However, you don't need to
implement the game itself yet. For this first step, just create a proper setup with the required libraries.
